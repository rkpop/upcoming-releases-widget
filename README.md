# /r/kpop Upcoming Releases Script (WIP)

A Ruby script that scrapes the upcoming-releases wiki and adds the entries to Google Calendar.

## Requirement

* Ruby 2.5+

* RubyGems

* Bundler

## Installation

* Git pull

* `bundler install --path vendor/bundle`

## Configuration

Copy `config.sample.toml` as `config.toml`, and fill out with the keys required by [Google Calendar API](https://github.com/northworld/google_calendar).
Refresh token should be generated by `bundle exec ruby obtain_refresh_token.rb` before running the script.

## Caveat

The script is unable to make a change on any entry's title.

## Progress

- [x] Upcoming-releases wiki scraping and input formatting

- [x] Google Calendar automatic addition

- [x] Database of added entries' ID for updating purposes
